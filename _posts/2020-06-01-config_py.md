I love configurations, I love YAML and I love Python. I try every time to make my code configurable, because I think
that it makes easier for an user to run, reproduce results and adjust the code to their own needs. 

Instead of dropping random numbers on my code, I like to create a configuration file and leave everything there. For 
that reason, I created a very simple class to deal with configuration files.

Since it deals with configurations, and it's written in Python, I thought that an original name for it would be config-py.
You can find it here:

{% include repo_card.html reponame=lucascoelhof/config-py %}

## Usage

So, let's say you have the following YAML config file:

{% highlight yaml %}
app_name: "One-million-dollar-app"
user: "barney_dinosaur"
pass: "iloveyouyouloveme"
{% endhighlight %}

In order to access your parameters, you can do this 
{% highlight python %}
from config_py import Config

# It assumes you have a config file named config.yaml, otherwise it will consider the file is empty. You can also pass the path of a yaml file with other names
config = Config()
# Parameters can be accessed in a dict structure
print(config["app_name"])
# Or in a object structure
print(config.user)
{% endhighlight %}

OK, but why use it? There are several other options:

* [configparser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html): It's based on .ini files... Which is used in Windows...
 It can't be good, then.
* [config-with-yaml](https://pypi.org/project/config-with-yaml/): Syntax is too complicated. Life is too short to type 
```config.getProperty("user")``` instead of just ```config.user```.
* I was lazy to continue this list, but I recently added a comments option below, feel free to comment more and I will add.
