I think one of the greatest things about internet is when you find in a blog of a random person the solution of a problem you just googled. One day I was thinking: I can move on with my work now because this gentle and lovely piece of humanity decided to take a bit of his time to describe the solution they've found in their blog. Touched by this idea, and intending to join the team of gentle and lovely pieces of humanity, I am starting this blog, also sharing the solutions of problems I face on daily basis, as a way to give back to the community somehow.

One critic to these blogs is that I always found that these personal blogs were merely informative. Im this blog, I will try to stick to my style: easy going, more relaxed way, with a lot of personal opinion, and trying to be funny. I mean, I will try do my best. Something more aligned to [WaitButWhy](https://waitbutwhy.com/) and [Casually Explained](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr3cBLTYmIK9kY0F_OdFWFQ), my favorite blogs.

First posts will be about previous projects I worked, Python and ROS packages I used and some random tips.
