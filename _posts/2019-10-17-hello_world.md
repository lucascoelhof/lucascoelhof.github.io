I think one of the greatest things about the internet is when you find in a blog of a random person the solution to a problem you just googled. One day I was thinking: I can move on with my work now because this gentle and lovely person decided to take a bit of his time to describe the solution they’ve found in their blog. Touched by this idea, and intending to join the team of gentle and lovely people, I am starting this blog. I will share the solutions of problems I face on daily basis and write about my projects as a way to give back to the community somehow.

One problem of these blogs is that I always found the posts were merely informative. In this blog, I will try to stick to my style: easy-going, more relaxed way, with a lot of personal opinions and trying to be funny. I mean, I will try to do my best. Something more aligned to [WaitButWhy](https://waitbutwhy.com/) and [Casually Explained](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr3cBLTYmIK9kY0F_OdFWFQ), my favorite blogs.

The first posts will be about previous projects I worked, Python and ROS packages I used and some random tips.
