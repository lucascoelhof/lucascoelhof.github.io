As the time of this writing, we are facing the COVID-19 pandemic and I'm working from
home for 76 days. Since now I don't have to go to the office every day, I ended up
having more free time. I always had in my mind that a good day is a productive day, so I felt
I should continue some of my personal projects I abandoned and use this blog here that I never actually
written on to describe what I did and brag about it on LinkedIn. 

The project I chose was a continuation of a previous project, that I developed during
an assignment on my Self-Driving Car Engineer at Udacity. It consisted of a deep-neural-network
that learns how to drive a car in a simulator my mimicking your drive behavior. It 
would use your throttle and steering inputs and the camera image to train the neural network
to behave as you would. Here is the repo:

But the simulator used on this assignment is not really great, so I wanted to use 
a better and more fun alternative. I found a [series of tutorials from sentdex](https://pythonprogramming.net/game-frames-open-cv-python-plays-gta-v/)
(which I strongly recommend watching, this guy is awesome), in which he used GTA V as a simulation
platform. 

So the idea was settled, get the neural network and the simulation environment and apply.

But then, since the idea was to publish something online, probably a LinkedIn post... I had in my mind it must be perfect. 
That I should do an amazing job. So then I started to elaborate a lot on the requirements of the project and the things it should do.
It may sound ridiculous, but I even started to think about how I would test this same neural network in my car, but for 
that I needed to install sensors on it, deal with hardware to collect data, and so on. I created a Trello board and started
to write all the steps of the project there. I contacted some friends and groups to talk about the idea and how I would collect the data.
Then I found out that getting this data from my car wouldn't be that simple. Then I also found
out that extracting this info from GTA V directly would need me to write a plugin. I started writing the plugin and 
I also found out that it wasn't that simple. Then I started losing motivation. If it wasn't 
perfect in the way I planned, it wasn't worth the time and attention to make. Then I abandoned the project.

After some weeks, I stumbled upon this video on YouTube:

If you are reading this post until this point, I assume you are a perfectionist and have empathized with me. So, please, watch it.

The last phrase of the video is this one:

> ### Do not let the pursuit of perfection stop you from creating.

And that made me raise my butt from the sofa and start again my personal project. With a much simpler approach. Just reach
the first goal, then I can evolve, and maybe one day test in the vehicle as I wanted. Or maybe not, maybe I will see a better
perspective or use case that I haven't thought before.

And that also made me think about why I haven't written a single blog post on this site too: everything here needed to be 
perfect in some sense, so it required me a lot of effort and then I would not start doing it or procrastinate to 
another time.

I started to think about the other departments of my life that I also made perfectionism freeze the development of
certain skills and plans. Being a bit deeper, I think all this perfectionism is linked to fear of failure and fear of
being judged badly. And honestly, that's not something I should be worried about. Or you should be worried about.

Anyways, in conclusion, I will be sharing more here, since it doesn't need to be perfect or something I need to brag about.
The idea of this website is to be informative and help people out with the content I write here, so no pressure on that. 
So, I will start with some posts about simple projects and tools but ultimately the autonomous driving with deep neural networks will
be featured here.
