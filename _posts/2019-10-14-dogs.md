## Pipoca

Pipoca means popcorn in Portuguese. Undefined breed, she was found in my uncle's farm as a little puppy and we think her mother was a wild dog. She loves cardboard boxes, don't like strangers at all and she is very shy, which makes us think that she is a cat in a dog's body.

## Paçoca

Paçoca is a pedigree labrador and mutt mix. Paçoca in Portuguese is a peanut and sugar candy, very popular in Brazil. She is a pretty normal dog, loves playing fetch, energetic, but a bit jealous of Pipoca.
