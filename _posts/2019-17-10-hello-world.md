So, I simply love when I find a blog of some random person that has faced the problem I was googling and I can move on with my work because this gentle and lovely piece of humanity decided to take a bit of his time to share the solution in their personal blog. My intention here is to join the team of gentle and lovely pieces of humanity, also sharing the problems I face on daily basis, and also a way to give back to the community somehow. 

I always found that these personal blogs were merely informative, but I will try to stick to my style: easy going, more relaxed way, with a lot of personal opinion, and trying to be funny. I will do my best. Something more aligned to [WaitButWhy](https://waitbutwhy.com/) and [Casually Explained](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr3cBLTYmIK9kY0F_OdFWFQ), my favorite blogs.

First posts will be about previous projects I worked, Python and ROS packages I used and some random tips.
