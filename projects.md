+ [Newatt Energy Systems](https://www.newatt.com.br/) - Provides a platform that allows users to monitor their energy usage and track inneficiencies. I was the CTO of the company, and responsible for techinical decisions and relations with investors and partners. I designed the first version of our hardware and worked a bit on the design of the cloud servers.

+ [Smartem Portable Calibrator](http://minipaelectric.com.br/produto/m100) - Smartem is a portable energy meter calibrator. It basically packs a calibration lab in a compact device alongside an app. It can reduce huge costs in energy meter calibrations, because with Smartem, they can be done on site, instead of taking the meter to a lab. I worked on the Android app and on the calibrator design and architecture, choosing the main chips of the device.
