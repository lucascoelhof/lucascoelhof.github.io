+ [Hexagon/Mineral Resources Autonomous Train](https://hexagon.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/2023/hexagon-equips-the-worlds-first-fully-autonomous-road-trains) - A solution based on Mission Manager to provide autonomous haulage to road trains. I was the lead developer of the project, and I was responsible for the architecture of the solution from the Hexagon Mining side (there was multiple Hexagon divisions involved). It was at the time of this writing the [biggest deal Hexagon has ever closed](https://www.investmets.com/hexagon-chief-says-mine-automation-project-a-big-deal/).

+ [Hexagon Mining Mission Manager](https://hexagon.com/products/hxgn-autonomous-mining-mission-manager) - A solution to integrate Fleet Management System software into autonomous mining vehicles. I worked primarily on the DDS communication between the servers and the vehicles, but then my role evolved to be the lead developer of the project. I was responsible for the embedded part of the solution, and also for the server side application. I also worked on the integration of the solution with other Hexagon products, such as the [Collision Avoidance System](https://hexagon.com/products/hxgn-mineprotect-collision-avoidance-system) and the [Operator Assist](https://hexagon.com/products/hxgn-autonomous-mining-reverse-assist).

+ Newatt Energy Systems - Provides a platform that allows users to monitor their energy usage and track inneficiencies. I was the CTO of the company, and responsible for techinical decisions and relations with investors and partners. I designed the first version of our hardware and worked a bit on the design of the cloud servers. Newatt was sold to [Luminae](https://luminae.com.br/) in 2019.

+ [Smartem Portable Calibrator](https://www.eztron.com.br/smartemm-100/prod-8988287/) - Smartem is a portable energy meter calibrator. It basically packs a calibration lab in a compact device alongside an app. It can reduce huge costs in energy meter calibrations, because with Smartem, they can be done on site, instead of taking the meter to a lab. I worked on the Android app and on the calibrator design and architecture, choosing the ICs for energy measurement, microcontrollers, and wireless communication.

+ [Hexagon Mining Reverse Assist](https://hexagonmining.com/solutions/operations-portfolio/operator-assist/hxgn-mineoperate-reverse-assist) - Haul trucks are tremendously big, and as you can expect, the visibility of the surroundings of the vehicle is very poor. This is even more problematic in maneuvers next to other equipment, as shovels, excavators and crushers. Reverse Assist helps drivers on the backing maneuver, giving them the direction they should turn the steerning wheel to follow an optimal path, giving also collision alerts. On this project, I contributed developing a way for vehicles to share their dimensions to other vehicles nearby, making maneuvering in tight spaces or next to other vehicles safer.

+ [Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer](https://github.com/lucascoelhof/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3) - In 2019, I took a course on Udacity about autonomous vehicles. Even though I have a fairly good experience in robotics, I wanted to dive deeper into deep neural networks and investigate what kind of problems I could solve with it. On the previousl link, you can check the most fun project I've done on this course, which was programmming a neural network to copy my driving behavior.
