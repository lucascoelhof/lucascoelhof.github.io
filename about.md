title: About

I’m Lucas, I live in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. I passionate about robotics and autonomous vehicles. Currently, I work at Hexagon Mining as a Software Specialist, developing autonomous vehicles solutions for the mining industry. My main interests are ROS, path planning, machine learning, and multi-robot control. My favorite programming languages are C++ and Python. Outside work, I enjoy mountain biking, photography, talking in public and I am always planning my next travel destination. My friends say I’m a calm person, always eager to help, that loves learning and teaching what I know.

Talking a bit about my trajectory, I did my high school in a technical school ([CEFET-MG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Center_for_Technological_Education_of_Minas_Gerais)), where I fell in love with electronics and programming. Later on, I started my bachelor's in Control and Automation Engineering at [UFMG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Minas_Gerais). During this time, I worked for 3 years as a Research Assistant at [CORO](http://coro.cpdee.ufmg.br/) under the supervision of professor [Luciano Pimenta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jF9S_gMAAAAJ&hl=en). I worked with ROS, SLAM, multi-robot systems, built [Turtlebots](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/TurtleBot) and played with Kinect sensors. I also had the chance to study abroad at The University of Texas at Austin and did a short (but very productive!) internship at Boston University with professor [Mac Schwager](https://web.stanford.edu/~schwager/) (now at Stanford).

After graduating, I did a lot of exploring about career. I started my Masters in Electrical Engineering at UFMG, co-founded a [startup](https://www.newatt.com.br/), lived in The Netherlands because of the startup, came back to Brazil, quit the startup, started working at Hexagon and finished my masters. Meanwhile, I worked on some [projects](/projects) too.

Today, I'm fully focused on R&D on autonomous vehicles and robotics, because I strongly believe these technologies will dramatically change the world we live today. 

I started this blog because I wanted to share a bit of what I learn everyday, so I can help others and make the community stronger. Sometimes I will write in Portuguese.

## This page

I am actually very bad at frontend design, but I used some great open-source projects to make this page. Some fun facts about this website include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
* Used [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) as a template
* Got some ideas from [chrisschuld.com](https://github.com/cbschuld/chrisschuld.com) 
* [This page](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole) was really helpful to customize this blog as I always wanted
* Developed this website in about 3 hours (including setup and installation time).
* Here are my dogs, [Pipoca and Paçoca](/posts/2019-10-14-dogs/)


Thanks for reading!
