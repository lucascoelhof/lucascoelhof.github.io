I’m Lucas, I live in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. I passionate about robotics and autonomous vehicles. Currently, I work at Hexagon Mining as a Software Specialist, developing autonomous vehicles solutions for the mining industry. My main interests are ROS, path planning, machine learning, and multi-robot control. My favorite programming languages are C++ and Python. Outside work, I enjoy mountain biking, photography, talking in public and I am always planning my next travel destination. My friends say I’m a calm person, always eager to help, that loves learning and teaching what I know.

Talking a bit about my trajectory, I did my high school in a technical school ([CEFET-MG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Center_for_Technological_Education_of_Minas_Gerais)), where I fell in love with electronics and programming. Later on, I started my bachelor's in Control and Automation Engineering at [UFMG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Minas_Gerais). During this time, I worked part-time for 3 years as a Research Assistant at [CORO](http://coro.cpdee.ufmg.br/) under the supervision of professor [Luciano Pimenta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jF9S_gMAAAAJ&hl=en). I learned about ROS, SLAM and multi-robot systems, built [Turtlebots](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/TurtleBot) and played with Kinect and LiDAR sensors. I also had the chance to study abroad at The University of Texas at Austin and did a short (but very productive!) internship at Boston University with professor [Mac Schwager](https://web.stanford.edu/~schwager/) (now at Stanford).

After graduating, I did a lot of exploring about career. I started my Masters in Electrical Engineering at UFMG, co-founded a [startup](https://www.newatt.com.br/), lived in The Netherlands because of the startup, came back to Brazil, quit the startup, started working at Hexagon and finished my masters. Enterpreneurship was probably one of the greatest experiences of my life, but energy management wasn't really my thing, so I decided to focus on my passions: robotics and autonomous vehicles.

Today, I'm fully focused on R&D on autonomous vehicles and robotics, because I strongly believe these technologies will dramatically change the world we live today.

## This website

I started this blog because I wanted to share a bit of what I learn everyday, so I can help others and make the community stronger. Sometimes I will write in Portuguese.

I am actually very bad at frontend design, so this good looking page exists thanks to some great open-source projects. Some fun facts about this website include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
* Used [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) as a template
* Got some ideas from [chrisschuld.com](https://github.com/cbschuld/chrisschuld.com) 
* [This page](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole) was really helpful to customize this blog as I always wanted
* Developed this website in about 3 hours (including setup and installation time).

Thanks for reading!
