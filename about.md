## About myself

I am passionate about robotics and autonomous vehicles. Currently, I work at Realtime Robotics Inc. as a Senior Software Engineer, developing applications for robotic arm control using motion planner algorithms. My main interests are ROS, path planning, machine learning, and multi-robot control. My favorite programming languages are C++ and Python. Outside work, I enjoy mountain biking, photography, and I am always planning my next travel destination. My friends say Iâ€™m a calm person, always eager to help, that loves learning and teaching what I know.

* Got some ideas from [chrisschuld.com](https://github.com/cbschuld/chrisschuld.com)
* [This page](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole) was really helpful to customize this blog as I always wanted
* Developed this website in about 3 hours (including setup and installation time).
